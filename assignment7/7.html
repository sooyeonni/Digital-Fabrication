           <h2>Create and Design a mold üêª </h2>

            </p>
            <p> To design the CAD for the silicon mold, I conducted the "Draft angle analysis" to figure out the parting line and made a mid draft curve first. Then I designed the outside part of the model it self, which has a V shaped hole so that later plaster can be put in there. </p>  
            </p>
      
      
      

     <h2>3D Print the mold üñ® </h2>

           </p>
            
           <p>First, I printed a small modle to see how it look, and then resize the mold to print an actual for the casting.  The 3D printed model was perfect and took almost 5 hours to print it. I used the Dremel printer at the Mill. </p>
          


            <h2>Create the Silicon Mold ü•õ </h2>

<p> With the mixture of the Ooomoo, I poured them in a different cup and mix them together. It became thicker, so I poured them in the mold that I designed. And I waited for 6 hours to make the silicon mold to be thicken. </p>
    
     <h2>Casting Plaster üêª‚Äç‚ùÑÔ∏è</h2>

            </p>
<p> It was a bit challenging to take it out. I tried not to tear the silicon, and I made it.  </p>


            <h2>Final Deliverable</h2>
            <p> This is the final casted design that I made. I eventually failed to create the perfect shape that I designed for the mold. The mold was not completely filled with the plaster. After my initial and second try, I couldn't do more experiments because I didn't have enough plaster and also time. However, I learned a few steps I need to be aware of for my next molding and casting work. </p>

 <h2>What I learned </h2>
<p> - Make the hole for plaster more larger, (especailly the enterance of the hole) so that the plaster can go through well.</p>
<p> - Plaster will be thicken in a quick time, so be aware the time. </p>
<p> - Make the mold completly filled with the plaster. </p>
<p> - Make supporter more stable (rubber band is not enough!!), so the plaster will not leak. </p>
