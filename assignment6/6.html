           <h2>Part 1 : Your final lamps ðŸ’¡ </h2>

            <p> Coming from an idea that cat loves boxes, I came up with an idea to combine stl mesh of a sitting cat and a box. I found this cute cat stl modeling at Thinggivers and downloaded it to modify the mesh. I imported the mesh file (stl format) in to Rhino and change the display and texture. And then I reduced the meshes to decrease the number of poly faces. I used the MeshToNurb command to create a closed mesh model. 
 <p>

           </p>
            
           <p>Then I found this cute Mario box in Thingivers and then reduced the mesh to decrease the polygon surfaces. The box size was too big for the cat model, so I scaled down the box to make the cat fit in. And then, I combined the two meshes into one figure and imported them to CURA to see whether they were ready to be printed in a single figure. It turned out that the two meshes combined and closed well </p>

            <h2>Part 2 : Design Lamp Innered ðŸ’¡ </h2>
            <p> For the lamp innered design,I collected some images and references to create a moodboard for inspiration and ideas. I have a blue color filament, so by using it, I want to have a lamp that creates a shadow of waves. </p>
            
                 <h3>Moodboard & Inspiration </h3>
           <p>
                <img src="img5.png" width=800></a>
            </p>
            <h3> Lamp Measurement </h3>
              <p>
                <img src="img6.png" width=800></a>
               <p> To design the lamp innereds that can be exactly fit in to the lamp, I used calipers to measure the size and length of the current lamp structure.</p>

        <h3> Lamp Design </h3>
<p>
                <img src="img7.png" width=800></a>
           

</p>
<p> This is the initial sketch of the lamp design. I want to put the wave pattern in the outside of the lamp holder, so it can reflect the shadow of the lamp. I put the small empty space in the bottom of the innereds to pull out the wire extension and make the lamp stand on the ground. </p>

   <h3> Lamp Modeling </h3>

   <h3> Lamp Printing</h3>

 <p> I exported the model into Cura. For the 3D printing, I used the 3D printer in the mill, which is Dremel ECO ABS. For the priniter setting, I set the quality as "High Speed", 10% Infill.
