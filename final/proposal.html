            <h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <p> Josun style traditonal square lamp </p>
         
          
           <h2>Concept : Joseon style traditional glass lamp </h2>          
              <p>

            </p>
  
            
            <p> This is a traditional Korean-style square glass lamp that was used in the Joseon dynasty, usually in the palace. This lamp usually hangs outside the palace when a party or event happens all night. I found the images of this lamp in the article and decided to re-design it in my style with the techniques that I learned during the digital fabrication class. </p>  
            </p>
      
      
      

     <h2>Ideation and Moodboard üé® </h2>

           </p>
            
           <p> This is the mood board that I created for the lamp design. I used a warm color palette and traditional Korean drawings using nature elements like flowers, bamboo, and butterflies.  </p>
          


   <h2>Initial Sketch & Break Down Tasks ‚úçÔ∏è </h2>

 <p>
                <img src="sketch.png" width=800></a>
            </p>

<p> 1. Laser Cutting : outside lamp wall (acrylic plates), structure of the lamp (woodboards)</p>
<p> 2. 3D Prinitng : Decoration of the Lamp </p>
<p> 3. Grasshopper : To design the outisde lamp wall </p>
<p> 4. Rhino : Design the lamp structure, decoration parts of the lamp </p>

     <h2>Hanji - Traditional Korean Paper </h2>

 <p>
                <img src="hanji.png" width=800></a>
            </p>

<p> Hanji is a traditional homemade paper.  It is made from the inner bark of mulberry, a tree native to Korea and Hibiscus meninot, which helps suspend the individual fibers in water. It has unique texture and transparency. </p>


            <h2>Project Timeline</h2>

</p>
   
   <h2>Project Materials </h2>
 <p> This is the list of materials for the final project. I mentioned the usage of each materials, required qauntities, and their price. I also added the current status so that I can figure out what itmes I currently have and need to order in advance.

 <h2>Current Process </h2>
<p>
                <img src="butterflies.png" width=1000></a>
</p>
<p> According to my timeline, I need to consider the Mill's closing time so I already printed some 3D decoration parts for the lamp at Mill. I used a transparent filament so the lamp light can go through easily. </p>
